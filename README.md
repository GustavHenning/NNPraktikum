We use Python 2.7, not Python 3.x

## Requirements

You have to install two 3rd-party packages: Numpy and scikit-learn.

### Numpy

You might have to install numpy manually. Please follow the
[official guide](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html) to do so.

### Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is also called sklearn. Don't be confused by that, it is the same
package. Please follow the
